									<h1>Coding<br />
									Expierence</h1>
									<p>Most of my computer science expierence is in the Java language. In my college, Java is primarily used <br />
									and taught and it is mostly used when it comes to examples. By extension, I am comfortable in javascript and after that<br />
									is the C language and Python. I've been using Java for a long time and I have become more comfortable with C and have come to 
									appreciate how different they are while still having similarites.</p>

								<h2>Other<br />
								Expierence</h2>
								<p>I was involved in a project that had to develop a menu for a veterinarian office that needed to keep track of a patient"s pet
								information. The software would promt the user if they wanted to create a new patient file, check-in, make an appointment, and etc.
								I worked in a group of four and we develop this software in a 5 month time span. The entire expierence was really rewarding. I never did
								anything at the level and it made me want to develop more software and create things that could make things even easier for the user.</p>

								Expierence<h3/>
									<p>At the end of my semester we have worked on a project that has pushed what I know about coding
									and what I know about myself as a coder. I learned about coding languages such as php and css. I know now 
									that there is a lot of different styles of coding from working with my group and how hard it is to understand
									each others work if we don't all agree to a certain style of coding.<p/>
